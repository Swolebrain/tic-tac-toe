what is phonegap?

what is cordova? Apache Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you to use standard web technologies - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each device's capabilities such as sensors, data, network status, etc.

What does this mean?

modalities:
- phonegap desktop/CLI and phone client 
- phonegap build

Generic steps: have some code on YOUR github, create phonegap account, get signing keys, upload signing keys, create phonegap app, build it

Phonegap build docs: http://docs.phonegap.com/phonegap-build/
--Create an account at build.phonegap.com
--File structure Requirements (both for build and desktop, do not mix!)
--Download or clone the jquery tic tac toe plugin or open up your own:
	https://github.com/Swolebrain/tic-tac-toe
--Bring over my sample config.xml and go over it, stripping it of everything we dont need
--Create your own github repo out of it

Next is generating the keys: http://docs.phonegap.com/phonegap-build/signing/android/
keytool is in C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_91\bin
command is: keytool -genkey -v -keystore tictactoe.keystore -alias tictactoe -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

Next, we add the key to our phonegap build application.

Then we create the phonegap app, discuss hydration and debugging.

Finally we build it.

Test it and it fails, so we need to enable debugging.
